                    The valley of Kashmir is as rich with history and political controversy as it is with culture and natural phenomena. Sample exquisitely spiced native cuisines and festive teas, then walk off your meal along the rugged trekking routes to the north. Marvel at the famous houseboats of Srinagar and take a spiritual moment to reflect at one of the many pilgrimage sites and religious shrines that dot the region. Of course, native craftsmanship makes for excellent souvenirs—carpets and textiles are an especial shopping must.

                                        Every winter, Gulmarg is overrun with skiers hoping to catch some of the best powder in India. But it’s more than just a winter destination—spring and summer transform the slopes into lush flower-dotted meadows with clear views of the Himalayas all around. You can hit the links at one of the highest golf courses in the world, make a wish at the sacred Baba Reshi Shrine, and ride the Gulmarg Gondola (another highest in the world) for even better panoramic views.                                        </p>
