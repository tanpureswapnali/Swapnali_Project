                    The descent to the Nongriat double-decker root bridge is an epic one. You begin at the tip of the valley close to the village of Tyrna and climb down approximately 3000 steps. On the way, there are plenty of stunning vistas and natural sights to soak in.
The root bridges of Meghalaya are an enigma, an integral part of the old Khasi lifestyle that dates back to the times when trekking through thick forests and negotiating fast-flowing rivers was a part of the routine.

                                        At close to 900 metres above sea level, Tura Peak is a haven for nature lovers and those interested in bird watching and photography. The hills around Tura are thriving with life – species like hornbills and gibbons are just some of the many treasures of this diverse and rich landscape. A trip to Tura Peak brings you up close to the beauty, as you climb up to one of the highest points in the district.

                                    Balpakram, ‘the land of perpetual winds’, may not be well-known to the outside world but it is an important part of Garo folklore. Its unchartered jungles, massive cliffs, and powerful rivers have birthed many stories of the paranormal type, including that of the stalking ‘mandeburung’, or man of the jungle, straight out of the cryptozoologist’s handbook

                                    Ever thought of a place where waterfalls are so plentiful that they become a nuisance? That can be the scene on the highway to the famed town of Mawsynram when your vehicle might just have to drive right through a monsoon cascade falling from the mountainside.The Mawsynram plateau region has received enough attention for its world-record rainfall but there are many more unique sights here.</p>

                                    Sohra has stories hidden all over – in its rivers, cascades, and mist-shrouded hill-tops. It is also the place where civilizations met, the cultural capital of the Khasis and the gateway of the colonial age. The terrain comes alive during the monsoons while the drier months are all about blue skies and scenic hikes and treks. The region around Sohra is synonymous with waterfalls                     </p>
